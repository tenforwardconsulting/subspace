# Subspace

Subspace is a rubygem meant to make provisioning as easy as Capistrano makes deploying.

## Installation

First, install ansible (>2.0)

OSX:
  brew install ansible

linux:
  apt-get install ansible


Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'subspace'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install subspace

Then run

    subspace init

## Usage

* `subspace init`

Initialize the project for subspace. Creates `config/provision` with all
necessary files.

* `subspace provision <environment>`

Runs the playbook at `config/provision/<environment.yml>`.

# Development

## Directory Structure

`ansible/roles`

Contains all of our custom roles. When the gem is installed and `subspace init`
is ran, the newly created `ansible.cfg` will be configured to look for these
roles.

`template`

Contains the template files that get copied over when `subspace init` is ran.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

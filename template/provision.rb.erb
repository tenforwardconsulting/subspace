## Subspace configuration file
#
# This file contains all (most?) the configuration for provisioning servers to run this rails application.
# It uses a simple DSL that should be easy to pick up if you're comfortable with things
# like rails environments, devise config, capistrano, etc.
#
# When you run `subspace`, the following files be overwritten.  DO NOT MANUALLY MODIFY THESE FILES.
#
# config
# - provision
#   - group_vars/*
#   - host_vars/*
#   - ansible.cfg
#   - hosts
#   - playbook.yml

# Step one: Configure your deployment environments.  We usually have a "dev" and a "production"
# environment.  Sometimes we have a "staging" or qa.  You can do whatever you'd like.

Subspace.configure do |config|
  # Project level configuration

  # Name of the project.  This will get used all over the place in path names, config file names, etc.
  config.project_name = "<%= File.basename FileUtils.pwd =>"

  # By default the name of the host and the group are the same for one-host groups
  config.host :dev, {
    ssh_host: "1.2.3.4",          # Ansible connects to this to provision
    ssh_user: "deploy",           # ssh user
    sudo: true,                   # probably should be true if user isn't root
    hostname: "dev.example.com"   # This will get set in /etc/hostname
  }


  # Configuration for a group of hosts
  # These hosts
  config.group :dev, {
    hosts: [:dev, :dev_web1],
    vars: {
      rails_env: "dev"
    }
  }

  config.group :production, {

  }
  # Configure the ansible roles that the project will use.  This is where you can set up things like
  # nginx vs apache, postgres vs mysql, etc. You can configure variables with each role or globally.
  # In Ansible, all variables are global not scoped to a role, and you can override the defaults per-host or per-group.
  # For convenience, we put all the default variables for each role in a block, but the following two lines have
  # identical effect:
  #
  # config.role "myrole" {|vars| vars.option "new_value" }
  # config.var :option. "new_value"

  config.role "common", vars: {
    # swap_space: 536870912,
    # deploy_user: "deploy"
  }

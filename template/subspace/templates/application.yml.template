# This file defines the environment variables available to the application at runtime
# We use the figaro gem to load environment variables from application.yml.

# These environment variables are available to all environments, and can be secret or not:

# These are secret and can be changed per environment easily by using subspace vars <env> --edit
# SECRET_KEY_BASE: {{SECRET_KEY_BASE}}
# AWS_SECRET_KEY: {{AWS_SECRET_KEY}}

# These are not secret, and have the same value for all environments
# ENABLE_SOME_FEATURE: false
# MAX_USER_INVITES: 20
# DEFAULT_EMAIL_ADDRESS: test@example.com


# These variable are not secret, but have different, static values for all environments
development:
  # INSECURE_VARIABLE: "this isn't secret"
  # AWS_BUCKET: my-app-development

dev:
  # INSECURE_VARIABLE: "but it changes"
  # AWS_BUCKET: my-app-dev

production:
  # INSECURE_VARIABLE: "on different servers"
  # AWS_BUCKET: my-app-production
